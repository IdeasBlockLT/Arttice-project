### For Individual Creators and Field Professionals
This platform is open to all fields of arts and culture, whether you are a visual artist, musician, writer, dancer, designer, cultural manager, curator - you name it. It aims to provide professionals working in the field of culture with more visibility, opportunities to exchange ideas, get inspired, find open calls and work opportunities, connect and collaborate with one another, promote yourself and your works, as well as reach and co-operate with cultural organisations and venues.
